## Installation

### Firefox

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
5. Select the `manifest-firefox.json` file from the repository

### Chrome

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the repository folder
6. Make sure you're using `manifest-chrome.json` (rename it to `manifest.json`)

## Usage

1. Navigate to your Costco Account Home page (any URL containing `accounthome`, such as):
   - https://www.costco.com/accounthome
   - Or click "Account" from the Costco homepage
2. Log in to your Costco account if needed
3. The extension interface will appear in the top-right corner
4. Select your desired start date (defaults to 3 years ago)
5. Click "Download Receipts"
6. Your receipts will be downloaded as `costco-[timestamp].json`

## Receipt Viewer

The repository includes a standalone web viewer ([`viewer/`](viewer/)) for browsing and searching the JSON file you download. It runs entirely in your browser — no build step, no server, and no data ever leaves your machine.

### Running it

**Option 1 — Open the file directly (simplest):**

```bash
open viewer/index.html
```

This opens the viewer in your default browser via the `file://` protocol. All parsing and searching happen client-side, so this is all you need.

**Option 2 — Serve it locally (if you prefer `http://`):**

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000/viewer/](http://localhost:8000/viewer/) and stop the server with `Ctrl+C` when done. (`npx serve` works too.)

### Using the viewer

1. Click the dropzone (or drag and drop) and select your downloaded `costco-[timestamp].json` file.
2. The viewer parses the file and shows summary stats (receipt count, net total, instant savings, warehouses visited) plus a list of receipts.
3. Type in the **search box** to filter receipts in real time — it matches product descriptions, item numbers, warehouse name/city/state/zip, transaction type, dates, totals, and payment methods (e.g. `modelo`, `redwood city`, `refund`). Matches are highlighted.
4. Click any receipt to expand its line items, taxes, payment tender, and savings.
5. Click **"Load different file"** to start over with another JSON export.

## Building/Packaging

You have several options to package the extension:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Automated - Recommended)

Every push to `main` or pull request automatically builds both versions:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
3. Download the built extensions from the artifacts

**To create a release:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
This will automatically create a GitHub release with both extension files attached.

This will create both Firefox and Chrome packages in the `dist/` folder.

### Option 3: Use npm Scripts

```bash
npm run build           # Build both versions
npm run build:firefox   # Build Firefox only
npm run build:chrome    # Build Chrome only
```

### Option 4: Manual Packaging

**Firefox:**
```bash
cp manifest-firefox.json manifest.json
zip -r costco-receipt-downloader-firefox.xpi manifest.json content.js
rm manifest.json
```

**Chrome:**
```bash
cp manifest-chrome.json manifest.json
zip -r costco-receipt-downloader-chrome.zip manifest.json content.js
rm manifest.json
```

## Data Format

The extension downloads receipts in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "warehouseName": "Costco Wholesale",
    "transactionDate": "11/20/2025",
    "total": "123.45",
    "itemArray": [
      {
        "itemDescription01": "Product Name",
        "amount": "19.99",
        ...
      }
    ],
    "tenderArray": [...],
    "couponArray": [...],
    "subTaxes": {...}
  },
  ...
]
```

## Privacy & Security

- ✅ Only runs on Costco.com pages
- ✅ Uses your existing Costco authentication
- ✅ No data sent to external servers
- ✅ All processing happens locally in your browser
- ✅ No tracking or analytics

## How It Works

1. The extension injects a UI into the Costco Order Status page
2. When you click "Download Receipts", it queries Costco's GraphQL API
3. The API request uses your existing authentication tokens from localStorage
4. Receipt data is fetched and formatted as JSON
5. The file is downloaded directly to your browser's download folder


## Troubleshooting

### Button doesn't appear
- Ensure you're on the Costco Account Home page (URL should contain `accounthome`)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that the extension is enabled in your browser
- Make sure you're logged in to your Costco account

### Download fails
- Make sure you're logged into your Costco account
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify you have receipts in the selected date range

### No receipts downloaded
- Adjust the start date to cover a period when you made purchases
- Ensure your Costco membership is active
